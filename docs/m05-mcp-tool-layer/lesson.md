# Chapter 5: MCP and the Tool Layer

<Slides src="decks/m05-mcp-tool-layer.html" title="M5: MCP and the Tool Layer" />

## Recap: Skill, Hook, and Now MCP

Module 4 gave the agent a packaged capability, a skill: instructions it reaches for on its
own, when the task matches. Module 6 will give it something it cannot opt out of, a hook:
a check that runs at a fixed point, no matter what the agent wants. This chapter sits
between the two. It gives the agent a third kind of extension, a live connection to a real
system, so it can read real, current state instead of guessing.

All three, skill, hook, and MCP, live in the harness layer from module 1. None of them
replace the harness. Each one is one more piece of it.

## Before MCP: One-Off Integrations

Before MCP existed, every agent vendor wrote its own bespoke connector to every tool it
wanted to reach. One vendor's connector to the Terraform registry. A different connector
from a different vendor to the same registry. Multiply that by every tool and every
vendor, and you get a real maintenance problem: the same handful of tools, wired up again
and again, slightly differently each time.

## MCP: One Protocol, Many Clients

MCP, the Model Context Protocol, is nothing but a shared interface. One server exposes a
tool, or a resource, once. Any agent client that speaks the protocol can call it. The
tangle from the last section turns into spokes: one connection from each agent client to
the shared protocol, one connection from the protocol to each tool.

![After MCP: three agent vendors each speak one shared protocol to a hub, and the hub holds the connection to the terraform registry, github, and a cloud provider.](./diagrams/after-mcp-spokes.svg)

Would you call MCP a new idea? Not really. It's the same move as an ODBC driver or a
POSIX system call, one interface, many implementations behind it, many callers in front of
it. What's new is that agents are the caller.

## What an MCP Tool Call Actually Is

Here's the distinction worth being precise about, because "skill" and "MCP tool" get
confused constantly. A skill is packaged instructions the agent follows itself, using its
own reasoning and whatever it already knows. Nothing external gets called. An MCP tool
call is different: the agent asks a real, external server to do something, and a real
answer comes back. A skill can only ever suggest what the agent should do. An MCP tool
returns what's actually true, right now, on the other end of that connection.

![Three harness components compared: a skill is packaged instruction the agent follows itself, a hook is an enforced gate that runs regardless, and MCP is a live call out to an external system that returns real data.](./diagrams/skill-hook-mcp.svg)

## Stale Training Data Is a Real Failure Mode

A model's knowledge of a provider's current arguments comes from whatever it was trained
on, and training data has a cutoff. A provider that ships a new release next month is
invisible to a model trained before that release existed. Ask the model anyway, and it
won't usually refuse, it'll answer from memory, with whatever confidence it happens to
have.

Here's a real example, captured while this module was being built, not invented for the
page. The exact same question, asked of the exact same agent, twice:

> "What's the latest version of the kreuzwerker/docker Terraform provider?"

Asked from memory alone, with no MCP server available, the answer was **"~3.6.2, best
guess, not certain."** Asked again with the Terraform MCP server available, the agent
called `get_latest_provider_version` and got back the real number from the registry:
**4.5.0**. Not close. A learner trusting the first answer would have written a version
constraint against a release that's several minor versions behind current.

![A real captured example: from memory, a guess of roughly version three point six point two, low confidence. With the terraform MCP server available, the real answer from the registry, version four point five point zero.](./diagrams/stale-vs-live.svg)

This is what an MCP tool buys you that a skill can't: not a better-worded suggestion, an
actual answer, sourced from the actual current state of a real system.

### Try it: stale vs live lookup

Toggle the Terraform MCP server on and off against the real captured question above, plus two
more in the same spirit: [Stale vs Live Lookup Simulator](pathname:///310-agentic-iac-site/sims/stale-vs-live-sim.html).

## A Live Lookup Can Build the Real Thing, Not Just Answer a Question

Everything so far has been a lookup: ask a question, get a real answer instead of a guess.
That's useful, but it undersells what a live connection is for. The lab's flagship exercise
goes one step further: use the Terraform MCP server to look up `aws_db_parameter_group`, a
resource most people have never written by hand, and then actually build it, an RDS instance
with a real, non-default parameter attached, applied against Floci and verified.

The lookup and the build are two different disciplines. The lookup tells you `family` is
the only required argument, and that the MySQL 8.0 family value follows a naming pattern the
docs don't spell out literally (`mysql8.0`, inferred from `mysql5.6`/`mysql5.7` examples, not
copied from a literal doc string). The build tells you whether the resource you wrote
actually does what you meant: whether `aws_db_instance.app`'s `parameter_group_name` really
matches the parameter group you created, not just sits next to it in the same file.
Terraform will happily apply a module where those two names silently drift apart, nothing
errors, the parameter group just never attaches. Checking `terraform show -json` after
apply, not just after writing the HCL, is what catches that.

## Official Doesn't Mean Ready

One more real result belongs in this chapter, because it's a genuinely useful lesson and it
would be dishonest to leave it out just because it's inconvenient. `aws-iac-mcp-server` is
named, in this course's own conventions, as the AWS-endorsed successor to the deprecated
`awslabs/terraform-mcp-server`. It's real. `uvx awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server@latest` really
installs, 86 real packages, a real dependency tree including `cfn-lint` and `botocore`. Then
it crashes on startup: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastmcp.server.proxy'`.
Pinning an older `fastmcp` doesn't fix it, it trades one crash for a different, real one, a
`pydantic` incompatibility this time.

Two facts sit side by side here, and a working engineer needs both. First: the server's
documented tool list is real and would genuinely help if part of your stack is CloudFormation
or CDK, `validate_cloudformation_template`, `check_cloudformation_template_compliance`,
`search_cdk_documentation`, none of it Terraform-specific, all of it CFN/CDK-scoped. Second:
it doesn't start, today, in a clean environment. "Official" describes who publishes a
package. It says nothing about whether the package runs. Verify an MCP server actually
connects, and actually covers the IaC tool you're using, before you build a workflow that
assumes it will.

![A real attempt to run aws-iac-mcp-server: it installs, eighty six real packages, then crashes on startup with a real module not found error. Its documented tools are CloudFormation and CDK only, never Terraform.](./diagrams/aws-iac-mcp-honest.svg)

## Opening a Pull Request Is Not Merging It

The GitHub MCP server lets an agent do real things on a real repository: read files, open
branches, open a pull request. That last one is worth slowing down on, because "the agent
can open a PR" sounds, at first, like a step up in autonomy. It isn't.

Opening a pull request is a proposal. Nothing merges until a human reviews the diff and
clicks merge. The authority boundary from module 1, the agent proposes, the pipeline
decides, holds exactly as written here. The agent's reach through MCP still ends at
"here's a change, please look at it."

![An agent opens a real pull request through the GitHub MCP server, but merging is a separate action a human still has to take, the same authority boundary from module one's thesis diagram.](./diagrams/pr-not-merge.svg)

## Still Step 3

Put those two capabilities together, a live documentation lookup and the ability to open a
real pull request, and it can feel like the agent just got a lot more powerful. It did,
in one sense: it can now reach real systems instead of working only from what's in the
repo and what it remembers. But reach is not autonomy. A human still reads the plan before
anything real happens. This module's lab sits at the exact same place on the autonomy
ladder as module 4's: step 3, propose with plan. MCP adds capability. It does not add a
step.

![The six-step autonomy ladder from module one, with step three, propose with plan, highlighted. MCP adds capability, real tool calls and live data, without moving a workflow to a higher step.](./diagrams/still-step3.svg)

## MCP Servers Are Still a Permission Surface

One more thing worth saying plainly before the lab: an MCP server is not automatically
safe just because it's official. What it can read and what it can write is configured,
same as the permission boundary module 6 teaches for hooks. A GitHub MCP server holding a
token with write access to every repository you own is a different risk than one scoped to
a single throwaway repository. Configure the narrowest scope that does the job, the same
instinct you'll formalize properly in module 6.
