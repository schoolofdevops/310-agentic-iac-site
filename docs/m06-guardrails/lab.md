# Lab 6: Three Ways to Stop a Dangerous Apply

**Tier 1** · ~40 min · Docker socket mounted, `floci/floci:1.7.0` pinned, real `terraform apply`
and `destroy` against it, real Claude Code sessions in `--permission-mode plan`.

**The project:** a small, real storage system, two S3 buckets, one of them holding a genuine log
file, that an agent could delete for good with a single misread instruction. You build three
independent guardrails around that one system and test all three against the exact same real
delete, so you can see, on the same object, what each one costs and what each one actually stops.

M04 gave the agent a skill it could choose to reach for. That's still voluntary. This lab builds
three things that don't depend on the agent deciding anything: a **mechanical gate** that reads a
real plan and refuses a real delete, a one-paragraph preview of a **structural** guardrail that
removes apply access from the agent entirely, and a **plan-review-approve-apply harness** you
build yourself, wrapping the real `--permission-mode plan` mechanic M02 taught into a formal
propose-then-approve workflow. You'll watch a real delete destroy a real object with no gate in
the way, then watch the exact same delete get refused once the gate is wired in, then build a
second, independent guardrail on top of it that a human has to approve before anything applies.

By the end you'll have a small library of your own: `hooks/blast_radius_gate.sh` and
`harness/{propose,approve,apply_with_approval}.sh`, three real scripts that stand between an agent
and a real apply, all proven against the same bucket that started this lab.

## Pre Requisites

- Completed M01, or at least read its `reading/concepts.md` (blast radius is defined there)
- Docker reachable at `/var/run/docker.sock`:

```
docker info
```

## The starting infrastructure

`file: lab/module/main.tf`
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "artifacts" {
  bucket = "m06-lab-artifacts"

  tags = {
    Environment = "lab"
    Owner       = "m06-lab"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
  bucket        = "m06-lab-logs"
  force_destroy = true

  tags = {
    Environment = "lab"
    Owner       = "m06-lab"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}
```

`force_destroy = true` is doing real work here, and it's realistic, not a contrived flag added
just for this lab. Without it, deleting a bucket that still has objects in it fails outright: real
AWS, and Floci behind it, both refuse with `BucketNotEmpty`. That refusal is itself a small
guardrail, the provider's own. A lot of teams turn `force_destroy` on precisely to stop that error
from failing CI, and the moment they do, the provider's own guardrail is gone. What's left to
stand between an agent and a real object being destroyed for good is exactly what this lab builds.

**Copy** the lab into a scratch directory and **start** Floci, same Tier 1 setup every lab in
this course uses:

```
cp -r modules/module-06-guardrails/lab ~/m06-lab
cd ~/m06-lab
docker run -d --name floci -p 4566:4566 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  floci/floci:1.7.0
```

**Apply** the baseline:

```
terraform -chdir=module init -backend=false
terraform -chdir=module apply -auto-approve
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.logs: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts: Creation complete after 0s [id=m06-lab-artifacts]
aws_s3_bucket.logs: Creation complete after 0s [id=m06-lab-logs]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Two real buckets, in a real backend container, same as M04.

## Run 1: no gate, watch a real delete destroy real data

An empty bucket getting deleted is easy to shrug off. **Put** something real in it first:

```
echo "2026-08-30 03:14:02 auth-service ERROR db timeout after 30s, retrying" > /tmp/app.log
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 \
  s3 cp /tmp/app.log s3://m06-lab-logs/2026-08-30/app.log
```

That's a real object, in a real bucket, in the real Floci container. Now **delete** the `logs`
bucket resource from `module/main.tf` (comment it out or remove the block), and **apply** again,
with nothing in the way:

```
terraform -chdir=module apply -auto-approve
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
  # aws_s3_bucket.logs will be destroyed

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
aws_s3_bucket.logs: Destroying... [id=m06-lab-logs]
aws_s3_bucket.logs: Destruction complete after 0s

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

**Check** what's left of the object:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 \
  s3 ls s3://m06-lab-logs/2026-08-30/
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
An error occurred (NoSuchBucket) when calling the ListObjectsV2 operation: The specified bucket does not exist.
```

Not "moved to a recycle bin," not "recoverable within 30 days." The bucket and the log line inside
it are both just gone. No pause, no confirmation beyond the usual `-auto-approve`, no record of
why. An agent running unattended at a high autonomy step with no gate would do exactly this, on
your say-so or on a misread intent, and there's nothing between the plan and the damage.

**Restore** the `logs` block, re-apply, and re-upload the object, so you're back to where you
started before the next step:

```
terraform -chdir=module apply -auto-approve
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 \
  s3 cp /tmp/app.log s3://m06-lab-logs/2026-08-30/app.log
```

## Write the gate

**Write** the piece that was missing: a script that reads a real `terraform plan`, in JSON, and
decides whether it's safe to apply at all.

`file: hooks/blast_radius_gate.sh`
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -uo pipefail
PLAN_JSON="${1:?usage: blast_radius_gate.sh <plan.json>}"
MAX_RESOURCES="${MAX_RESOURCES:-5}"
BLOCK_ON_DELETE="${BLOCK_ON_DELETE:-1}"
HIGH_RADIUS_TYPES="${HIGH_RADIUS_TYPES:-aws_vpc,aws_iam_policy,aws_iam_role}"

TOTAL=$(jq '[.resource_changes[] | select(.change.actions != ["no-op"])] | length' "$PLAN_JSON")
DELETES=$(jq '[.resource_changes[] | select(.change.actions | index("delete"))] | length' "$PLAN_JSON")

if [ "$BLOCK_ON_DELETE" = "1" ] && [ "$DELETES" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "BLOCKED: ${DELETES} delete action(s) in this plan." >&2
  exit 1
fi
if [ "$TOTAL" -gt "$MAX_RESOURCES" ]; then
  echo "BLOCKED: ${TOTAL} resource changes exceeds max-resources ${MAX_RESOURCES}." >&2
  exit 1
fi
IFS=',' read -ra TYPES <<< "$HIGH_RADIUS_TYPES"
for t in "${TYPES[@]}"; do
  HIT=$(jq --arg t "$t" '[.resource_changes[] | select(.type == $t) | select(.change.actions != ["no-op"])] | length' "$PLAN_JSON")
  [ "$HIT" -gt 0 ] && { echo "BLOCKED: touches high-radius type '${t}'." >&2; exit 1; }
done
exit 0
```

Three policies, in order: block any delete, block a batch over `MAX_RESOURCES` (default 5), block
a change to a resource type on the high-radius list (`aws_vpc`, `aws_iam_policy`, `aws_iam_role` by
default). Exit 0 means safe to apply. Exit non-zero means refuse. `hooks/apply_with_gate.sh` wraps
`terraform plan` → `terraform show -json` → this script → `terraform apply`, in that order, and
never reaches `apply` if the gate exits non-zero.

## Run 2: the same delete, the same real object, now blocked

**Delete** the same `logs` bucket block again. This time, **apply** through the gate instead of
directly:

```
./hooks/apply_with_gate.sh
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
==> gate: 1 resource change(s), 1 delete(s), max allowed 5
BLOCKED: 1 delete action(s) in this plan. block-on-delete is on.
  - delete: aws_s3_bucket.logs
apply refused: gate blocked this plan.
```

Exit code 1. **Check** the bucket, and the object inside it, are still there:

```
terraform -chdir=module state list
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 \
  s3 ls s3://m06-lab-logs/2026-08-30/
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts
aws_s3_bucket.logs
2026-09-01 17:18:13         70 app.log
```

Same delete, same real object at risk, same underlying `terraform apply` call. The only thing
that changed is whether a gate sat between the plan and the apply. That's the whole lesson of
mechanism one, in one before/after: the same `force_destroy = true` bucket, the same auth-service
log line, destroyed for good in run 1, still there in run 2.

**Restore** the `logs` block once more before continuing.

## A safe change still passes

Not every gate is a wall. **Add** a small, non-destructive change, a new bucket:

`edit file: module/main.tf`
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "docs" {
  bucket = "m06-lab-docs"
  tags = { Environment = "lab", Owner = "m06-lab", ManagedBy = "terraform" }
}
```

```
./hooks/apply_with_gate.sh
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
==> gate: 1 resource change(s), 0 delete(s), max allowed 5
    ok, gate passes
aws_s3_bucket.docs: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.docs: Creation complete after 0s [id=m06-lab-docs]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

No delete, under the resource-count limit, no high-radius type. The gate isn't there to say no to
everything, it's there to say no to the specific things that make infrastructure mistakes worse
than application-code mistakes: no undo, blast radius, silent failure, the three properties from
M01's reading.

## A permission boundary, alongside the hook

A hook decides whether a proposed *change* is safe. A permission boundary decides what the agent
can even touch in the first place, before a plan exists at all. In this repo that's a Claude Code
settings file, not a Terraform concept:

`file: .claude/settings.local.example.json`
```
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Write(shared/**)",
      "Edit(shared/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This is a config-level guardrail: the agent's write tools are denied on anything under `shared/`,
enforced by the harness before the agent ever gets a chance to propose a change there, the same
way the gate above is enforced before `apply`. This lab doesn't stage a live denied-write
transcript, that depends on the specific agent runtime enforcing it, but the mechanism is the same
shape as the hook: a rule that runs regardless of what the agent decided to do.

## Mechanism two: stop asking whether the agent should apply

The gate above answers "is this specific plan safe?" every single time, correctly, but it's still
sitting downstream of a system where the agent has `apply` access at all. There's a structurally
different guardrail: take that access away entirely. An agent never runs `terraform apply` against
anything real. It opens a PR instead. The PR runs through the same kind of checks this module just
built, an automated review, a human merges it, and a separate GitOps controller, reconciling
against the merged state of the repo, is the only thing that ever touches the real infrastructure.
"Can this agent apply?" stops being a question the gate has to answer correctly every time, because
the agent was never wired to `apply` in the first place. That's not a small variation on this
lab's gate, it's a different shape of guardrail, structural instead of mechanical, and building it
for real, with a real GitOps controller reconciling a real merged PR, is M11's job, not this
module's. Hold onto the shape: gate the change, or remove the ability to make it unreviewed.

## Mechanism three: propose, review, approve, apply

The gate blocks based on what a plan contains. It doesn't know who's asking, and it doesn't pause
for a human to actually read the reasoning before something happens. M02 already showed you the
real building block this needs: `claude --permission-mode plan` proposes a change and writes
nothing, an agent hands you a plan document instead of a fait accompli. This lab turns that one
flag into a small, real harness with four real steps, and an explicit refusal wired into the
middle of it.

`file: harness/propose.sh` (step a and b: a real agent proposes, a real plan gets saved)
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -uo pipefail
ASK="${1:?usage: propose.sh \"<intent>\"}"
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."

BEFORE=$(date +%s)
claude -p "${ASK} Propose the exact HCL to add to module/main.tf. Do not write any files, this is a proposal only." \
  --permission-mode plan
...
cp "$LATEST" "plans/${SLUG}"
echo "PLAN_SAVED: plans/${SLUG}"
```

**Run** it against a real ask:

```
cd modules/module-06-guardrails/lab
./harness/propose.sh "Add a new S3 bucket resource named 'audit' with bucket name 'm06-lab-audit'."
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
**Proposed HCL**, append to `module/main.tf`:

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "audit" {
  bucket = "m06-lab-audit"
  ...
}

PLAN_SAVED: plans/add-a-new-s3-squishy-metcalfe.md
```

Plan mode really did write nothing. `module/main.tf` is untouched. What exists now is a plan file,
under `plans/`, the same real artifact `--permission-mode plan` produces in M02, just copied
somewhere your team can actually review it instead of a hidden home-directory path. Your filename
will differ, plan mode's naming isn't deterministic, the shape is what matters.

**Try** applying it anyway, before anyone approved it:

```
./harness/apply_with_approval.sh plans/add-a-new-s3-squishy-metcalfe.md
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
REFUSED: plans/add-a-new-s3-squishy-metcalfe.md has not been approved. Run harness/approve.sh first.
```

Exit code 1, `module/main.tf` still untouched. Step (c), the human gate, is not optional and not
implicit, it's a file that has to exist:

`file: harness/approve.sh`
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -uo pipefail
PLAN="${1:?usage: approve.sh plans/<file>.md}"
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."
[ -f "$PLAN" ] || { echo "REFUSED: no such plan file: $PLAN" >&2; exit 1; }
APPROVER="${APPROVER:-$(whoami)}"
{
  echo "approved-by: ${APPROVER}"
  echo "approved-at: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  echo "approved-plan: ${PLAN}"
} > "${PLAN}.approved"
echo "APPROVED: ${PLAN} (by ${APPROVER})"
```

**Approve** it, for real, as yourself:

```
./harness/approve.sh plans/add-a-new-s3-squishy-metcalfe.md
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
APPROVED: plans/add-a-new-s3-squishy-metcalfe.md (by gshah)
```

**Apply** it now that the approval marker exists, step (d), the second real invocation, the only
one allowed to touch a file:

```
./harness/apply_with_approval.sh plans/add-a-new-s3-squishy-metcalfe.md
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
==> approval found: approved-by: gshah approved-at: 2026-09-01T11:42:04Z approved-plan: plans/add-a-new-s3-squishy-metcalfe.md
Done. `audit` bucket added, matches plan exact.
==> agent edited module/main.tf per the approved plan, now running the mechanical gate before any real apply
==> gate: 1 resource change(s), 0 delete(s), max allowed 5
    ok, gate passes
aws_s3_bucket.audit: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.audit: Creation complete after 0s [id=m06-lab-audit]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

A second, fresh Claude Code session read the approved plan and edited `module/main.tf` to match
it, nothing more, then this module's own `apply_with_gate.sh`, the mechanism you built first,
still ran before Terraform touched anything real. Two independent guardrails stacked on the same
apply: one asks who approved this, one asks what this plan actually contains. Neither one trusts
the other to have caught everything.

**Check** the state:

```
terraform -chdir=module state list
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts
aws_s3_bucket.docs
aws_s3_bucket.logs
aws_s3_bucket.audit
```

## Which failure was which

- The missing gate in run 1 wasn't a context problem or a skill problem. The agent (or you, by
  hand) had everything it needed to do the delete correctly. Nothing was there to say the delete
  itself was the problem, and a real object was gone for good because of it
- A skill (M04) could have suggested caution. It could not have stopped the apply. Only something
  that runs regardless of the agent's choice can do that
- The resource-type and resource-count checks generalize the same idea beyond deletes: some
  changes are risky by shape, not by action type alone
- Mechanism two doesn't try to out-think every dangerous plan, it just removes the agent's ability
  to apply anything unreviewed in the first place. Different failure mode, different fix
- Mechanism three doesn't replace the gate, it adds a second, independent question in front of it:
  not "is this plan safe" but "did a specific human actually say yes to this specific plan." The
  harness refused before approval existed, no matter how safe the plan looked

## Clean up

**Reconcile** and **destroy**, the numbered step every Tier 1 lab in this course ends with:

```
terraform -chdir=module destroy -auto-approve
docker rm -f floci
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 4 to destroy.
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts: Destruction complete after 0s
aws_s3_bucket.logs: Destruction complete after 0s
aws_s3_bucket.docs: Destruction complete after 0s
aws_s3_bucket.audit: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 4 destroyed.
```

#### Exercise

Set `MAX_RESOURCES=1` and try to apply the `docs` bucket addition together with one more new
bucket in the same plan. Then try touching an `aws_iam_role`. Write two lines in `notes.md`: which
of the three policies (delete, count, type) would your own team's worst past incident have
tripped, and would a human have caught it faster than the gate did?

Then try to break the harness: run `harness/propose.sh` for a plan that deletes the `logs` bucket,
approve it with `harness/approve.sh`, and apply it. Does the mechanical gate from mechanism one
still block it, even though a human already approved it? What does that tell you about which
guardrail should run last?

#### Summary

The project is done: one small storage system, three independent guardrails built and proven
against it. You watched an ungated delete destroy a real object with nothing stopping it, then
watched the identical delete get refused once a hook sat between the plan and the apply. A skill
can only ever suggest. A hook runs regardless. Then you built a second, independent guardrail on
top of it: a real `--permission-mode plan` session proposes, a real file gets saved, a real
approval step refuses to let anything through until a human says yes, and a second real session
applies exactly what was approved, still through the same mechanical gate. Three mechanisms,
three different answers to "how do you stop this": catch it by shape, remove the ability to do it
unreviewed, or require an explicit human yes before a second session is even allowed to act. Take
`hooks/blast_radius_gate.sh` and the `harness/` scripts with you, they're generic to any Terraform
plan, not specific to this lab's buckets. M08 picks this up and generalizes it into a full
harness, and M09 puts real cloud-shaped scanners in front of the same gate.

##### Re-verify

`lab/run.sh` runs the whole sequence for real: baseline apply, an ungated delete that destroys a
real object, the same delete blocked by the gate, a safe change that passes, a high-radius type
blocked, an oversized batch blocked, the full propose-approve-apply harness against a real Claude
Code session, then reconcile and destroy, all against a real Floci container. Run it whenever the
pinned Floci or Terraform versions in this lab get bumped:

```
cd modules/module-06-guardrails/lab
./run.sh
```
