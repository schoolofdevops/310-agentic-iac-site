# Project 03: Manage Context for an Nginx Module Using AGENTS.md and STATE.md

**Tier 0 → 1** · ~15 min · your own agent (Claude Code or Codex), the same
`terraform` and `checkov` from M01.

In this project, you will build one small Terraform module three times: an
nginx container serving a static page, with a sidecar credential for shipping
its access logs to S3. Each build proves a different claim about context
engineering: what a noisy scan actually costs you, what changes when you write
standing context down, and what survives a session with zero memory.

**What you're building, at a glance:**

- A real measurement of noisy versus filtered tool output on a 21-resource
  module, an ~85% size cut with the same findings
- The same nginx module, built twice from the same intent, once with no
  `AGENTS.md`, once with one
- A real hardcoded secret, caught by checkov, then fixed by writing the
  missing convention down
- A real `STATE.md` handed to a session with zero memory, verified to finish
  the job correctly
- A checkov-clean nginx module, plus three pieces of evidence for the three
  disciplines in `reading/concepts.md`: **Reduce**, filtering noisy tool
  output before it enters the window; **Retain**, standing facts that survive
  a session reset; **Route**, a plan written to disk so a zero-memory session
  can pick it up correctly

## Pre Requisites

- Completed M01's lab, or at least read `reading/concepts.md` for that module.
  This lab reuses M01's exact one-line intent.
- An agent you can prompt directly, Claude Code or Codex, from a terminal in a
  scratch directory.

## Stage 1: Reduce

### Step 1: Measure verbose versus compact checkov output

Before touching an agent at all, **measure** what a raw tool call actually
costs versus a filtered one. This stage needs more real findings than the
nginx module alone would produce, so it borrows a bigger, already-real module:
the 21-resource one from `labs/shared/floci-spike`, this course's own Tier 1
spike. You will come back to your own nginx module for stages 2 and 3.

```
cd labs/shared/floci-spike
checkov -d . --framework terraform > /tmp/verbose.txt
checkov -d . --framework terraform --compact --quiet > /tmp/compact.txt
wc -c /tmp/verbose.txt /tmp/compact.txt
```

`[ Approximate output ]`
```
   25605 /tmp/verbose.txt
    3881 /tmp/compact.txt
```

Same scan, same 25 findings. The only difference is whether every passed check
and every repeated source-code excerpt got printed too. That's an ~85%
reduction from one flag. **Read** `/tmp/verbose.txt` and count how many lines
you'd actually act on versus how many you'd just scroll past. That gap is
exactly what Reduce removes before it ever reaches an agent's context window.

## Stage 2: Retain

Now the standing-context discipline: build the real nginx module twice from
the same intent, once with nothing written down, once with a real `AGENTS.md`
in place, and read the difference for yourself. Here is the intent, read the
way an agent would:

> Give me a local nginx container for testing, serving a static page I control,
> with its rendered HTML kept on disk so I can diff it in git. No secrets in the
> container. I don't need it exposed outside this machine.

### Step 1: Run once with no context

**Copy** the no-context starter into its own run folder, so run 2 later still
gets an untouched starter to work from:

```
cp -r modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/starter modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/run1
cd modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/run1
```

**Open** Claude Code (or Codex) in that directory and give it the exact intent
above:

```
claude -p "Give me a local nginx container for testing, serving a static page I control, with its rendered HTML kept on disk so I can diff it in git. No secrets in the container. I don't need it exposed outside this machine." \
  --permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools "Read,Write,Edit"
```

This is what came back, captured for real, with no `AGENTS.md` anywhere in the
folder:

`file: run1/main.tf`
```
variable "log_shipper_key" {
  description = "AWS key for the sidecar that ships nginx access logs to S3"
  type        = string
  default     = "AKIAABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP"
}
```

**Scan** it:

```
terraform fmt -check
terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate
checkov -d .
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
Success! The configuration is valid.

Check: CKV_SECRET_2: "AWS Access Key"
	FAILED for resource: abac545fc3bf803134bc8f78fb6160a5c6a87b26
	File: /main.tf:32-33
```

`Exit code 1`. Same finding as M01, on purpose. Nothing here is invalid
Terraform. It's legal, it's readable, it just carries a convention nobody
wrote down: secrets never get a `default`.

### Step 2: Write the context

Now **write** the file that was missing. This is the actual deliverable of
this stage:

`file: run1/AGENTS.md`
```
# AGENTS.md, m03-lab

Standing context for this repo. Read this before writing or changing any Terraform here.

## Provider pins

- `docker` provider: `kreuzwerker/docker`, `~> 3.0`
- `local` provider: `hashicorp/local`, `~> 2.5`

Do not upgrade a pin without a reason stated in the commit message.

## Naming convention

Resource names: `m03-lab-<purpose>`, lowercase, hyphenated. Example:
`m03-lab-site`, not `site` or `my_container`.

## Module boundaries

This is a single-purpose module: one nginx container, its rendered HTML, and one
sidecar credential. Do not add unrelated resources here.

## Never do

- Never put a secret in a `default`. Every variable that holds a credential is
  `sensitive = true`, with no default, set via `TF_VAR_<name>` at runtime.
- Never run `terraform apply` before `terraform plan` has been read by a human.

## Where secrets come from

Environment variables only, `TF_VAR_log_shipper_key` for this module. Never a
hardcoded string, never a `.tfvars` file checked into git.
```

Keep it short. A file nobody reads is worse than no file at all.

### Step 3: Run again with context

Back at the repo root, `cp` a fresh copy of the starter into a second run
folder, then carry over the `AGENTS.md` you just wrote:

```
cp -r modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/starter modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/run2
cp modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/run1/AGENTS.md modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/run2/AGENTS.md
cd modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/run2
```

**Open** Claude Code (or Codex) in `run2` and give it the exact same
intent as Step 1:

```
claude -p "Give me a local nginx container for testing, serving a static page I control, with its rendered HTML kept on disk so I can diff it in git. No secrets in the container. I don't need it exposed outside this machine." \
  --permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools "Read,Write,Edit"
```

This module's captured, real run 2 is `lab/solution/main.tf`, produced with
`lab/solution/AGENTS.md` in place:

`file: lab/solution/main.tf`
```
variable "log_shipper_key" {
  description = "AWS key for the sidecar that ships nginx access logs to S3. Set via TF_VAR_log_shipper_key, never a default."
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

**Re-run** the same scan:

```
terraform fmt -check
terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate
checkov -d .
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
Exit code: 0
```

Same intent. Same agent. Same repo, minus one file.

### Step 4: Diff the two runs

**Compare** `lab/starter/main.tf` against `lab/solution/main.tf` yourself:

```
diff -u modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/starter/main.tf \
        modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/solution/main.tf
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
--- modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/starter/main.tf
+++ modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/solution/main.tf

 provider "docker" {}

   type        = string
-  default     = "AKIAABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP"
+  sensitive   = true
 }
 
 resource "local_file" "index_html" {
```

One variable block. That's the entire cost of writing `AGENTS.md` down once,
against the entire cost of a scanner catching a real credential in source
control after the fact. Notice which one you'd rather be doing every day.

## Stage 3: Route

Retain proved that standing facts survive a reset. This stage proves the
harder claim on the same module: an in-progress plan can survive one too, as
long as it never lived only in the conversation. The finding you are about to
hand off is the exact one Retain's run 1 uncovered, the hardcoded secret, now
picked up mid-fix by a session that never saw run 1 happen.

### Step 1: Write a real state file

**Write** a state file for an in-progress task, a real decision plus a real
next action, not a vague TODO:

```
mkdir -p modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/route
cp modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/starter/main.tf modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/route/
cd modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/route
```

`file: route/STATE.md`
```
## Where this stands
main.tf has one open finding: var.log_shipper_key carries a hardcoded default.
Checkov has not been re-run since the finding was found.

## Decision already made, do not re-litigate
We are NOT deleting the variable. The fix is: drop the default, add
sensitive = true, set via TF_VAR_log_shipper_key at deploy time.

## Next action
Edit main.tf: remove the default, add sensitive = true. Run checkov -d . and
confirm exit 0.
```

### Step 2: Hand it to a fresh session

**Close that terminal, or open a brand new one.** The point only holds if the
next command starts with genuinely zero memory of what you just did:

```
cd modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab/route
claude -p "Read STATE.md in this directory and do exactly what it says. Nothing else." \
  --allowedTools "Read,Write,Edit,Bash" --permission-mode acceptEdits
```

### Step 3: Verify the fresh session actually did it

**Verify** it, not just its claim:

```
cat main.tf
checkov -d .
```

`[ Approximate output ]`
```
variable "log_shipper_key" {
  description = "... Set via TF_VAR_log_shipper_key, never a default."
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```
```
Exit code: 0
```

Nobody re-explained the task to that session. Nobody re-argued the decision.
It read one file and finished the job correctly, because the file, not the
conversation, was carrying the plan. That's Route. A conversation you clear is
gone. A file on disk is still there.

## Which failure was which

Not every mistake an agent makes is a context problem. **Note** the
difference, because it's the seam between this module and M06:

- The secret-in-`default` mistake was context: nobody told the agent the
  rule, so it reached for the fastest thing that worked. Writing the rule
  down fixed it completely, on the first try.
- A mistake like "the agent wrote correct code but ran `terraform apply`
  before showing you the plan" is not a context problem. The agent might
  know the rule perfectly and still skip the step under time pressure. That
  needs a harness gate that makes the skip impossible, not a file that asks
  nicely. M06 builds that gate.

## Exercise

Delete one section from your own `AGENTS.md`, the naming convention or the
provider pins, and run the exact same intent a third time. Does the mistake
that section was preventing come back? Then, separately, write a `STATE.md`
of your own for something you're actually mid-way through this week, not a
lab exercise, a real piece of work. Write three lines in `notes.md`: which
`AGENTS.md` line turned out to be load-bearing, what surprised you about
handing your real `STATE.md` to a fresh session, and which of the three
disciplines, reduce, retain, route, you were worst at before this lab.

## Validation

Run the full check yourself, both runs, start to finish:

```
cd modules/module-03-context-engineering/lab
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` checks:

- Run 1 fails checkov on `CKV_SECRET_2`, the hardcoded secret
- Run 2 is clean, and `AGENTS.md` carries all four required sections

Run it whenever the pinned provider or checkov versions in this project get
bumped.

## Summary

What you built:

- Measured a noisy scan's real cost: the same 25 findings, ~85% less output,
  from one flag
- Built the same nginx module twice from the same intent, once with no
  `AGENTS.md`, once with one
- Caught a real hardcoded secret with checkov, then fixed it by writing the
  missing convention down, not by arguing with the agent
- Wrote a real `STATE.md`, handed it to a session with zero memory, and
  verified it finished the job correctly

None of this was a cleverer prompt or a bigger model. It was managing a
resource that resets, on purpose, in three specific ways, on one real piece of
infrastructure you can point to. M06 picks up where Retain's second finding
leaves off: the gate for mistakes that writing something down can't fully
prevent.
