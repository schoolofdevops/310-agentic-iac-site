# Project 04: Build a Terraform VPC Module Using a Claude Code Skill

**Tier 1** · ~40 min · Docker socket mounted, `floci/floci:1.7.0` pinned, real `terraform apply`
and `destroy` against it.

In this project, you will write a Claude Code Skill, then use it to scaffold and check a real
multi-environment VPC module. First you will write a plain-text skill and watch an agent pick
it up on its own, no re-explaining. Then you will write a second skill that bundles a real
script, one that catches a genuine CIDR overlap bug before it ever reaches `terraform apply`.

**What you're building, at a glance:**

- A prose-only skill that applies naming and tagging conventions to a single S3 bucket,
  proof the discoverability mechanism works before anything harder rides on it
- A second skill that **bundles a real, deterministic script**, not just instructions
- A real multi-environment VPC module: dev, staging, and prod, three environments that are
  genuinely different from each other, not a tfvars file with one number changed
- A real CIDR-overlap bug, caught by the script, then fixed
- A real `terraform apply` and `destroy` of the dev environment against Floci

Prose-only skills tell an agent what to do. A skill with a bundled script gives it something
to run, with an exit code that doesn't care how convincingly the agent reasoned. That's the
difference Stage 1 and Stage 2 exist to show you.

## Pre Requisites

- Completed M01 and M03, or at least read both modules' `reading/concepts.md`
- Docker reachable at `/var/run/docker.sock`, same check as every Tier 1 lab in this course:

```
docker info
```

## Stage 1: Write a skill for Terraform conventions

### Step 1: Read the worked example first

Before writing your own skill, **read** the one already in this repo:

`file: demos/m1-agent-preview/.claude/skills/container-conventions/SKILL.md`

Notice the pattern: a YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`, then plain instructions
in the body. The `description` field is the whole game. It's what an agent matches against
when deciding whether this skill applies to the task in front of it. A vague description
means the skill sits there, written, correct, and never triggered.

### Step 2: Run with no skill available

Copy the starter into a scratch directory, with no `.claude/skills/` anywhere in it:

```
cp -r modules/module-04-agent-skills/lab/starter ~/m04-run1
cd ~/m04-run1
```

**Open** Claude Code (or Codex) in that directory and give it this exact prompt, no skill
loaded anywhere yet:

```
claude -p "Give me a small S3 bucket for build artifacts, with a credential for the uploader sidecar that ships them there." \
  --permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools "Read,Write,Edit"
```

This is what came back, captured for real, with no skill in the folder:

`file: ~/m04-run1/main.tf`
```
variable "artifact_uploader_key" {
  description = "AWS key for the sidecar that uploads build artifacts to S3"
  type        = string
  default     = "AKIAQRSTUVWXYZ012345"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "artifacts" {
  bucket = "m04-lab-build-artifacts"
}
```

No `tags` block. No provider version pin in `provider.tf`. And the same mistake M01's lab
caught by hand: a credential sitting in a `default`. **Scan** it:

```
terraform fmt -check
terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate
checkov -d . --framework secrets
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
Success! The configuration is valid.

secrets scan results:

Passed checks: 0, Failed checks: 1, Skipped checks: 0

Check: CKV_SECRET_2: "AWS Access Key"
	FAILED for resource: 7cfe6c0f3efbed208df755d8278ea68915b97450
	File: /main.tf:9-10
```

`Exit code 1`. Unlike M01's `docker_container` and `local_file` resources, a real
`aws_s3_bucket` also picks up several S3-hardening findings from checkov's terraform
framework, missing encryption, missing versioning, and so on. Leave those for now. This
module's skill isn't scoped to fix general S3 posture, that's a systematic job for M09's
scanners. This skill is scoped to three things: provider pins, required tags, and secrets.

### Step 3: Write the skill

**Write** the skill that was missing. This is the actual deliverable of this stage:

`file: .claude/skills/terraform-module-conventions/SKILL.md`
```
---
name: terraform-module-conventions
description: Terraform conventions for this repo's AWS provider setup (Floci or real AWS). Use whenever asked to write, generate, or extend a Terraform module for an AWS resource.
---

# Terraform module conventions

Apply these rules to every Terraform module in this repo, whether or not the request
mentions them by name.

## Provider pins

- Pin the `aws` provider to `~> 6.0`, exactly as declared in
  `labs/shared/floci-spike/provider.tf`.

## Required tags

- Every taggable resource gets a `tags` block with at least `Environment`, `Owner`, and
  `ManagedBy`.

## Secrets

- Never a secret in a `default`. Every variable that holds a credential is `sensitive = true`,
  with no default, set via `TF_VAR_<name>` at runtime.
```

Keep the `description` specific. "Use whenever asked to write, generate, or extend a
Terraform module for an AWS resource" names the exact trigger. A description like "Terraform
best practices" is vague enough that an agent has nothing solid to match against, and the
skill goes unused.

### Step 4: Run with the skill available

Copy a fresh starter and put the skill next to it:

```
cp -r modules/module-04-agent-skills/lab/starter ~/m04-run2
mkdir -p ~/m04-run2/.claude/skills
cp -r .claude/skills/terraform-module-conventions ~/m04-run2/.claude/skills/
cd ~/m04-run2
```

**Open** Claude Code (or Codex) in `~/m04-run2` and give it the exact same prompt as Step 2:

```
claude -p "Give me a small S3 bucket for build artifacts, with a credential for the uploader sidecar that ships them there." \
  --permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools "Read,Write,Edit"
```

This module's captured, real run 2 is `lab/solution/main.tf`, produced with the skill in
place:

`file: lab/solution/main.tf`
```
variable "artifact_uploader_key" {
  description = "AWS key for the sidecar that uploads build artifacts to S3. Set via TF_VAR_artifact_uploader_key, never a default."
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "artifacts" {
  bucket = "m04-lab-build-artifacts"

  tags = {
    Environment = "lab"
    Owner       = "m04-lab"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform-module-conventions-skill"
  }
}
```

All three rules applied. You did not type any of them into the prompt this time. **Re-run**
the same scan:

```
terraform fmt -check
terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate
checkov -d . --framework secrets
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

`Exit code 0`, no secrets finding, nothing to report. The S3-hardening findings from the
terraform framework are still there, same count as run 1, because the skill was never scoped
to fix those. A skill fixes what it says it fixes, nothing more.

### Step 5: Apply and destroy against Floci

**Start** Floci per the Tier 1 rules used across this course:

```
docker run -d --name floci -p 4566:4566 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  floci/floci:1.7.0
```

**Apply** the module with the skill's fixes in place:

```
export TF_VAR_artifact_uploader_key="AKIAFAKELABKEY000111"
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts: Creation complete after 0s [id=m04-lab-build-artifacts]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

A real bucket, in a real backend container, not a plan file. **Destroy** it, the same
numbered step every Tier 1 lab in this course ends with:

```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
docker rm -f floci
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts: Destroying... [id=m04-lab-build-artifacts]
aws_s3_bucket.artifacts: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

### Which failure was which

Not every fix in this stage came from the same layer:

- The missing tags, the missing pin, and the hardcoded secret were all context problems, the
  skill fixed them on the first try, because the rule was written where the agent could read
  it and matched by a specific `description`
- The S3-hardening gaps, missing encryption, missing versioning, are not something a skill
  fixes by being invoked once. They need a gate that runs on every module, whether or not an
  agent decides to reach for a skill. That's the harness, coming in M06 and M08

#### Exercise: Stage 1

Take the `description` field in your skill and make it vague on purpose, something like
"Terraform best practices." Ask the same agent the same intent a third time. Does the skill
still get used? Write two lines in `notes.md`: what changed, and why a specific trigger
phrase matters more than a complete rule set nobody ever reaches.

## Stage 2: Scaffold and check a multi-environment VPC module

Stage 1's skill was prose. An agent read it and applied every rule, but nothing in it was
checked mechanically, if the agent had misjudged one line, nothing would have caught it. This
stage writes a skill that bundles a real script, so the check does not depend on the agent
reasoning its way through it correctly.

Here's what you're building: a shared VPC module, and three environments, dev, staging, and
prod, that are **materially different from each other**, not a tfvars file with one number
changed. This is the module every later environment in a real team's account would import
from, so getting the shared design right, and getting it checked mechanically, matters more
than any one environment's numbers.

`file: vpc/modules/vpc/variables.tf`
```
variable "environment"          { type = string }
variable "vpc_cidr"              { type = string }
variable "az_count"              { type = number }
variable "public_subnet_cidrs"   { type = list(string) }
variable "private_subnet_cidrs"  { type = list(string) }

variable "nat_strategy" {
  type = string
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["single", "per_az"], var.nat_strategy)
    error_message = "nat_strategy must be \"single\" or \"per_az\"."
  }
}
```

`nat_strategy` is the interesting one. `"single"` shares one NAT gateway across every private
subnet, cheap, and a single point of failure. `"per_az"` gives every AZ its own NAT gateway, so
one NAT outage never takes another AZ down with it. **Read** the full module at
`vpc/modules/vpc/main.tf`, then the three real environments:

| Environment | AZs | `nat_strategy` | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vpc/envs/dev` | 1 | `single` | Cheapest failure mode, nobody's on call for it |
| `vpc/envs/staging` | 2 | `single` | Enough spread to catch AZ bugs, NAT redundancy not worth it here |
| `vpc/envs/prod` | 3 | `per_az` | The one place a NAT gateway outage actually needs to stay contained to one AZ |

This is what an agent has to reason about, not just fill in variables. Two environments
share `nat_strategy = "single"` and still differ in AZ count. Only prod pays for `per_az`.

### Step 1: Write the skill that bundles a real script

**Read** `.claude/skills/vpc-environment-scaffold/SKILL.md`. Same frontmatter pattern as Stage
1's skill, but its instructions point at a real file:

`file: .claude/skills/vpc-environment-scaffold/scripts/check_cidr_overlap.py`
```
def find_overlaps(cidrs):
    envs = list(cidrs.items())
    conflicts = []
    for i in range(len(envs)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(envs)):
            name_a, net_a = envs[i]
            name_b, net_b = envs[j]
            if net_a.overlaps(net_b):
                conflicts.append((name_a, net_a, name_b, net_b))
    return conflicts
```

Plain `ipaddress` arithmetic, no model involved. The skill's instructions tell the agent to run
this **before** touching any environment's `vpc_cidr`, not to eyeball the numbers and decide
they look fine. Stage 1's skill could only suggest a correct answer. This one hands the agent
a program with an exit code.

**Run** it against the three real environments as they stand:

```
python3 .claude/skills/vpc-environment-scaffold/scripts/check_cidr_overlap.py vpc/envs
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
OK: no CIDR overlap across dev, prod, staging
```

### Step 2: Seed a real bug, watch the script catch it

Copy the three environments' `terraform.tfvars` to a scratch directory, then break one on
purpose, staging's CIDR shrunk to overlap dev's:

```
mkdir -p /tmp/m04-overlap-test/dev /tmp/m04-overlap-test/staging /tmp/m04-overlap-test/prod
cp vpc/envs/dev/terraform.tfvars /tmp/m04-overlap-test/dev/
cp vpc/envs/staging/terraform.tfvars /tmp/m04-overlap-test/staging/
cp vpc/envs/prod/terraform.tfvars /tmp/m04-overlap-test/prod/
python3 -c "
p = '/tmp/m04-overlap-test/staging/terraform.tfvars'
text = open(p).read().replace('10.11.0.0/16', '10.10.128.0/17')
open(p, 'w').write(text)
"
python3 .claude/skills/vpc-environment-scaffold/scripts/check_cidr_overlap.py /tmp/m04-overlap-test
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
CIDR OVERLAP DETECTED:
  dev (10.10.0.0/16) overlaps staging (10.10.128.0/17)
```

`Exit code 1`. A real collision, caught by arithmetic, not by an agent's judgment call about
whether two `/16` and `/17` blocks happen to share addresses. **Clean up** the scratch copy:

```
rm -rf /tmp/m04-overlap-test
```

### Step 3: Apply and destroy dev against Floci

**Start** Floci per the Tier 1 rules used across this course:

```
docker run -d --name floci -p 4566:4566 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  floci/floci:1.7.0
```

**Apply** the dev environment, the fastest of the three to check for real:

```
cd vpc/envs/dev
export TF_VAR_endpoint="http://localhost:4566"
terraform init -backend=false -input=false
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
module.vpc.aws_vpc.this: Creation complete after 0s [id=vpc-f9c4f9fe]
module.vpc.aws_nat_gateway.this[0]: Creation complete after 0s [id=nat-26db0bc3210fc76d2]

Apply complete! Resources: 12 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

nat_gateway_ids = [
  "nat-26db0bc3210fc76d2",
]
vpc_id = "vpc-f9c4f9fe"
```

Twelve resources: a VPC, an internet gateway, a NAT gateway with an Elastic IP, two subnets,
two route tables. All genuinely applied against Floci, not a plan file. **Destroy** it, the
same numbered step every Tier 1 lab in this course ends with:

```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
cd ../../../
docker rm -f floci
```

`[ Expected output ]`
```
module.vpc.aws_nat_gateway.this[0]: Destruction complete after 20s
module.vpc.aws_vpc.this: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 12 destroyed.
```

The NAT gateway is the slow one, real destroy-time behavior Floci models even though it is
an emulated API, not a real network path.

### What each layer actually caught

- The CIDR overlap is a **skill problem with a deterministic answer**. There's no judgment
  call, two ranges either overlap or they don't, so the skill doesn't just tell the agent to
  "check for overlaps", it hands it a script that decides.
- Whether prod should be `per_az` and staging shouldn't is **not** something the script checks.
  That's a design decision written into the skill's prose, the same kind of convention Stage 1
  taught, sitting right next to a rule the skill can mechanically enforce. A skill can carry
  both at once. Confusing "the script verified this" with "the agent decided this and I should
  double check" is the mistake to watch for once a skill starts bundling real code.

#### Exercise: Stage 2

Add a fourth environment, `qa`, 2 AZs, `nat_strategy = "single"`, CIDR `10.13.0.0/16`. Before
running `terraform validate`, run the overlap checker against `vpc/envs` with your new
environment in place. Then deliberately pick a CIDR that collides with `staging`'s
`10.11.0.0/16` and confirm the script still catches it. Write two lines in `notes.md`: what the
script caught that `terraform validate` never would have, and why.

## Validation

Run the full check yourself, both stages, start to finish, against a real Floci container.
This is what catches a regression if the pinned provider, checkov, or Floci versions in this
project ever get bumped:

```
cd modules/module-04-agent-skills/lab
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` checks:

- Stage 1: run 1 fails the secrets scan, run 2 is clean and carries the required tags and
  provider pin, then applies and destroys the solution module against a real Floci container
- Stage 2: all three VPC environments `validate` clean, the overlap checker passes on the real
  environments and correctly catches a seeded collision in a scratch copy, then applies and
  destroys the dev environment's twelve resources against a real Floci container

## Summary

What you built:

- A prose-only skill, picked up by an agent on its own, no re-explaining
- A real bug caught before it shipped: a hardcoded secret, fixed by the skill's rules
- A second skill that bundles a real script instead of just instructions
- Three genuinely different VPC environments, dev, staging, and prod, scaffolded and checked
  by that skill
- A real CIDR collision, seeded on purpose, caught by the script, not by an agent's judgment
- A real `terraform apply` and `destroy` of a twelve-resource VPC against Floci

A skill's prose can be followed or misjudged. A skill's bundled script either exits 0 or it
doesn't. Neither replaces the harness, M06 and M08's gates run whether or not an agent reaches
for a skill, but a skill that ships code closes more of the gap between the agent trying to
follow a rule and the rule actually being checked.
